  A declarative AI agent environment manager, written in Rust.

**About the name**

Name comes from the Japanese word **カセット** (*kasetto*) - cassette. Think of Skills, MCPs, commands, and instructions as cassettes you plug in, swap out, and share across machines.

## Why Kasetto

There are good tools in this space already - [Vercel Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs skills from a curated catalog, and [Claude Plugins](https://claude.com/plugins) offer runtime integrations. Both work well for one-off installs, but neither gives you a declarative, version-controlled config.

Kasetto is a **community-first** project that solves a different problem: **declarative, reproducible skill management across machines and agents.**

- **Declarative** — one YAML file, your whole setup: skills, commands, MCPs, instructions, and agents. Apply globally or scope to a project; configs compose with `extends`, so org, team, and project stay in sync.
- **Enterprise & private repositories** — pull from anywhere: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Gitea, and self-hosted instances, public or private. Onboard a new engineer with one command; everyone gets the same environment, zero drift.
- **Multi-agent** — write once, ship everywhere. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and [many more](#supported-agents) — one sync keeps them all current.
- **Skills, Commands, MCPs & Instructions** — four asset kinds, one source: skills, commands, MCPs, and instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, `AGENTS.md`, …). Everything is transformed into each agent's native format, and auto-merged. Distribute instructions, tools, and prompts as easily as sharing a repository link.
- **Speed** — instant by design. Built in Rust, it hashes content and diffs a lock file so only what changed gets touched — full syncs finish in seconds.
- **Universal** — one static binary for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Install as `kasetto`, run as `kst`. CI-friendly with `--json` output and real exit codes.

> Inspired by [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — the same lock-first, declarative, CLI-only ergonomics, applied to AI agent skills.

## Install

### Standalone Installer

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL kasetto.dev/install | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm kasetto.dev/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap pivoshenko/tap
brew trust pivoshenko/tap
brew install kasetto
```

### Scoop (Windows)

```bash
scoop bucket add kasetto https://github.com/pivoshenko/scoop-bucket
scoop install kasetto
```

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install kasetto
```

## Getting Started

**1. Scaffold a config:**

```bash
kst init            # creates ./kasetto.yaml in the current directory
kst init --global   # or a global one at ~/.config/kasetto/kasetto.yaml
```

Edit the generated `kasetto.yaml` — pick an `agent`, add a `skills:` source, and you're ready to sync. Or let Kasetto edit the config for you:

```bash
kst add https://github.com/anthropics/skills              # add every skill in the pack
kst add https://github.com/anthropics/skills@v1.2.0       # `@<ref>` shorthand (cargo/uv-style)
kst add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill pptx # or just named ones
kst add https://github.com/example/repo --skill find --mcp github --command review
```

`kst add` appends the source (keeping your comments) and syncs it in one step; `kst remove <source>` reverses it. See [cargo/uv-style editing](#commands) below.

**2. Sync skills into your agents:**

```bash
# uses ./kasetto.yaml in the current directory
kst sync

# or point at a shared team config over HTTPS
kst sync --config https://example.com/team-skills.yaml
```

Want bare `kst sync` to always pull from a remote URL? Persist it in `~/.config/kasetto/config.yaml`:

```yaml
source: https://github.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai/blob/main/kasetto.yaml
```

After that, `kst sync` resolves the URL automatically — no `--config` flag needed.

That's it. Kasetto pulls the skills, installs them into the right agent directory, and records exactly what it installed in `kasetto.lock`. Commit `kasetto.yaml` and `kasetto.lock` together (like `Cargo.lock` or `package-lock.json`) and every teammate gets identical versions. A plain `kst sync` honors the lock without re-resolving moving refs; `kst sync --update` rolls versions forward; `kst sync --locked` enforces the lock in CI.

See [pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai](https://github.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai) for a community example pulling skills from multiple packs for Claude Code and OpenCode.

**3. See what's installed:**

```bash
kst list                    # table of installed skills, MCPs, commands
kst list --type skills      # filter to one asset kind
kst doctor                  # version, paths, last sync status
```

## Commands

One-line synopsis below. Full flags and examples in the [commands reference](https://kasetto.dev/docs/commands).

- **`kst init`** — generate a starter `kasetto.yaml` (local or `--global`).
- **`kst add <source>`** — append a source to the config (comments preserved) and sync it in. Kind-tagged repeatable flags `--skill`/`--mcp`/`--command`/`--instruction` name entries (a lone `*` is a wildcard; no flags ⇒ `skills: "*"`), so one `add` can touch several lists. Accepts a cargo/uv-style `<source>@<ref>` shorthand and deep `blob`/`tree` browse URLs — the latter decomposed into source + `ref`/`branch` + `sub-dir` (+ skill name for a `SKILL.md` link); `--ref`/`--branch`/`--sub-dir` override. `--dry-run` previews the edit; `--no-sync` edits without installing; `--locked` keeps the follow-up sync offline; `--json` for scripting.
- **`kst remove <source>`** (alias `rm`) — drop entries from the config and prune the now-unconfigured assets. Mirrors `add`: `--skill`/`--mcp`/`--command`/`--instruction` (repeatable) subtract named entries (last one drops the whole entry; a lone `*` drops it outright); no kind flags removes the source from every list. `--ref`/`--branch` (or the `@<ref>` shorthand) disambiguate a repeated URL. `--dry-run` previews; `--no-sync` edits only; `--locked` and `--json` mirror `add`.
- **`kst lock`** — re-resolve every source and pin it into `kasetto.lock` without installing; skills become offline-ready for `sync --locked`, MCP/command/instruction revision pins refresh. `--check` (alias `--locked`/`--frozen`) verifies the lock matches the config without writing (CI-friendly); `-P`/`--upgrade-package <name>...` re-resolves only the named skills' sources.
- **`kst sync`** — read config, install skills + MCPs + commands + instructions into agent dirs honoring `kasetto.lock`; `--update` rolls pins forward, `--locked`/`--frozen` enforce the lock without fetching.
- **`kst list`** — print a uv-style table of installed skills, MCPs, commands, and instructions from the lock file; `--type skills|mcps|commands|instructions` filters; `--json` for scripting.
- **`kst doctor`** — local diagnostics: version, paths, last sync status, broken skills.
- **`kst clean`** — remove tracked skills and MCP configs for the given scope.
- **`kst self update`** — fetch latest release, verify SHA256, replace binary in place.
- **`kst self uninstall`** — remove installed assets, data, and the binary.
- **`kst completions <shell>`** — emit shell completion script (`bash`/`zsh`/`fish`/`powershell`).

Most commands accept `--json`, `--color <auto|always|never>`, `-q`/`--quiet` (repeat for stricter silence), and `--project | --global`. `--plain` is still accepted as a deprecated alias for `--color never`.

## Configuration

When `--config` is omitted, Kasetto looks for config in this order:

1. `$KASETTO_CONFIG` env var
2. `./kasetto.yaml`
3. `source:` key in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kasetto/config.yaml`
4. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kasetto/kasetto.yaml` (or `~/.config/kasetto/kasetto.yaml`)

Run `kst init` to scaffold a local config, or `kst init --global` for the global one.

## Private Repositories & Enterprise

Private GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Gitea, and self-hosted instances work via env-var tokens (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `GITEA_TOKEN`, etc.) — no login command, no credentials file. The same tokens apply to remote `--config` URLs.
